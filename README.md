# Smart India Hackathon Project - Team Insight 

## Project Overview

Welcome to the README for our Smart India Hackathon project! Our project focuses on enhancing the security and efficiency of railway stations using CCTV surveillance. We have developed a comprehensive solution that leverages computer vision, machine learning, and web technologies to address four key areas:

1. **Garbage Detection and Management**: We have implemented a garbage detection system using CCTV cameras. This system identifies garbage and alerts station staff to take appropriate action, ensuring a clean and safe environment for passengers.

2. **Crowd Management**: Our system uses real-time analysis of CCTV footage to monitor crowd density and provide insights to station authorities. This helps in optimizing crowd control and ensuring passenger safety.

3. **Work Monitoring**: We offer a work monitoring solution that tracks the progress of maintenance and construction projects at the station. It provides real-time updates to project managers and allows for efficient resource allocation.

4. **Crime Prevention**: We've incorporated a crime prevention module that uses AI to detect and prevent criminal activities. It can alert security personnel in real-time and provide evidence for investigation.


## Technology Stack

Our solution is built on a robust technology stack, including:

- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - YOLO (You Only Look Once)
  - MobileNet (Crime Detection)
  - Custom Trained Model (Cleanliness)
  - TensorFlow (Module Used for Training ML Model)

- **User Interface**:
  - Streamlit: We've developed a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit for easy access to the system's features.

- **Image Processing**:
  - OpenCV and Pillow: Used for image analysis, object detection, and tracking.

- **Data Analysis**:
  - Matplotlib: Used for plotting graphs.
  - Pandas and NumPy: Utilized for data manipulation.
  - SciPy: Used for statistical analysis.

- **Collaborative Tools**:
  - GitHub: Utilized for version control and collaboration.
